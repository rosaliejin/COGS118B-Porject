World's Suicide Rate prediction

In this project, we performed the analysis on suicide rates over 30 years from 1985 to 2015 across 100 countries with different demographic and socioeconomic features recorded. We applied linear regression, decision tree, and random forest modeling on our preprocessed data. Comparing the results from these three different approaches, we hope to retrieve more information behind the suicide data and predict future suicide rates by investigating the driving factor of this phenomena.
